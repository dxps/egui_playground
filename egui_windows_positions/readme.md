# egui_windows_positions

A sample to show how to open windows to specific positions so that they are open side by side.

<br/>

## Run

Use `./dev.sh` to start in _development mode_ (hot-reload, etc).

### Learning about egui

`src/app.rs` contains a simple example app. This is just to give some inspiration - most of it can be removed if you like.

The official egui docs are at <https://docs.rs/egui>. If you prefer watching a video introduction, check out <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtUkr_z7l84>. For inspiration, check out the [the egui web demo](https://emilk.github.io/egui/index.html) and follow the links in it to its source code.

### Testing locally

`cargo run --release`

On Linux you need to first run:

`sudo apt-get install libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev`

On Fedora Rawhide you need to run:

`dnf install clang clang-devel clang-tools-extra libxkbcommon-devel pkg-config openssl-devel libxcb-devel gtk3-devel atk fontconfig-devel`

<br/>

### Web Locally

You can compile your app to [WASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) and publish it as a web page.

We use [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) to build for web target.

1. Install the required target with `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
2. Install Trunk with `cargo install --locked trunk`.
3. Run `trunk serve` to build and serve on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Trunk will rebuild automatically if you edit the project.
4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html#dev` in a browser. See the warning below.

> `assets/sw.js` script will try to cache our app, and loads the cached version when it cannot connect to server allowing your app to work offline (like PWA).
> appending `#dev` to `index.html` will skip this caching, allowing us to load the latest builds during development.

<br/>

### Web Deploy

1. Just run `trunk build --release`.
2. It will generate a `dist` directory as a "static html" website
3. Upload the `dist` directory to any of the numerous free hosting websites.
